### About
This project is a photographer site template developed for a client. It's based on a template by [Format](https://format.com/), with some modification requested by the client.

Decided to move the project off Format as they didn't allow full flexibility with coding changes, so I created this template and moved it into a [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/) website ([The Craft Version is Now Public](https://github.com/mwikala/katwamba-craft/) :partying_face: ), easy for the client to manage.
